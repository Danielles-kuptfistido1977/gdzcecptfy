Just walked out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Novocaine and, man, where do I even start? The 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮's lingering in my brain like that weird smell when you open a cabinet under the sink. You know it’s there and kinda unsettling, but you can’t help but keep sniffing. Steve Martin, of all people! This isn’t him strumming a banjo, that’s for sure.

So. Novocaine. It’s like they took a dental drill and went caveman on my nerves. You’ve got this dentist mixed up in crime — classic story, right? Not really. It's more like pulling the wrong tooth. By the end, you’re sitting there thinking, was that supposed to hurt or be funny? Or both? Helena Bonham Carter, she’s like a mix of raccoon and goddess, running around causing chaos and all. You end up kinda liking her, even though she’s a total trainwreck. It's like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a cat try to open a door, you know there's no logical way out, but damn if you don’t wanna see it happen.

> There’s this part where they go full-on Hitchcock on us. Like, am I in a dental chair or a suspense thriller? The whole time I'm just clutching my popcorn, half expecting my dentist to jump out from behind the screen. Is it a comedy? Is it a thriller? Probably just like those mystery leftovers in the fridge, a little bit of everything.

Even the colors are out to get you. Sappy and sterile bright, then suddenly all gloomy. Got me feeling toothache and sweet nostalgia all at once - who does that!?

if (SteveMartin.isDentist &&  .hasCrime) { console.log(Welcome to my nightmare); }

You know what, it doesn’t even make sense to good-ol plumber me. But maybe that’s the point. Like, don’t try to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   with logic or reason, just let it go round like a plunger in a clogged toilet. Messy and maybe even a little satisfying when it clears.

Would I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again? Heck, maybe! It’s like finding an old toolbox. You open it, half expecting it to collapse, but then you find that one tool you forgot you had a year ago, and suddenly you’re glad you did. Me and Novocaine, yeah, we got some unfinished business. Go 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   and tell me if I’m crazy. Or not. Whatever.
